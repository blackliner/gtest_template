Given a positive integer number (eg 42) determine
its Roman numeral representation as a String (eg "XLII").
 
You cannot write numerals like IM for 999.
Wikipedia states "Modern Roman numerals are written by
expressing each arabic digit separately, starting with the
leftmost digit, and skipping any digit with a value of zero."
For example:
 
1990 -> "MCMXC"  (1000 -> "M"  + 900 -> "CM" + 90 -> "XC")
2008 -> "MMVIII" (2000 -> "MM" + 8 -> "VIII")
  99 -> "XCIX"   (90 -> "XC" + 9 -> "IX")
  47 -> "XLVII"  (40 -> "XL" + 7 -> "VII")
 
The 'digits' are as follows:
 
1 ->    "I" | 10 ->    "X" | 100 ->    "C" | 1000 ->    "M"
2 ->   "II" | 20 ->   "XX" | 200 ->   "CC" | 2000 ->   "MM"
3 ->  "III" | 30 ->  "XXX" | 300 ->  "CCC" | 3000 ->  "MMM"
4 ->   "IV" | 40 ->   "XL" | 400 ->   "CD" | 4000 -> "MMMM"
5 ->    "V" | 50 ->    "L" | 500 ->    "D" |
6 ->   "VI" | 60 ->   "LX" | 600 ->   "DC" |
7 ->  "VII" | 70 ->  "LXX" | 700 ->  "DCC" |
8 -> "VIII" | 80 -> "LXXX" | 800 -> "DCCC" |
9 ->   "IX" | 90 ->   "XC" | 900 ->   "CM" |

1. Only one small-value symbol may be subtracted from any large-value symbol.
2. The symbols "I", "X", "C", and "M" can be repeated three times in succession, but no more. (They may appear more than three times if they appear non-sequentially, such as XXXIX.) "D", "L", and "V" can never be repeated.
3. "I" can be subtracted from "V" and "X" only. "X" can be subtracted from "L" and "C" only. "C" can be subtracted from "D" and "M" only. "V", "L", and "D" can never be subtracted.
